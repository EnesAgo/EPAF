                    When we talk about air or water pollution, the reactions garnered are stronger. This is because we can see the effects caused by the pollutants and their extent very clearly. It is normal human psychology to believe in what you see firsthand. Our land, on the other hand, is living a nightmare too. <br />
                    <br /> <br />
                    We may not be able to see the effects with clarity, but the land is being polluted and abused constantly, and we are unable to calculate the damages incurred. Land Pollution has emerged to become one of the serious concerns that we collectively battle. <br />
                    Land pollution, in other words, means degradation or destruction of the Earthâ€™s surface and soil, directly or indirectly, as a result of human activities. Anthropogenic activities are conducted citing development, and the same affects the land drastically as we witness land pollution. <br />
                    <br /> <br />
                    By drastic, we are referring to any activity that lessens the quality and/or productivity of the land as an ideal place for agriculture, forestation, construction, etc. The degradation of land that could be used constructively, in other words, is land pollution. <br />
                    <br /> <br />
                    Land Pollution has led to a series of issues that we have come to realize in recent times, after decades of negligence. The increasing numbers of barren land plots and the decreasing numbers of forest cover are increasing at an alarming ratio. <br />
                    <br /> <br />
                    Moreover, the extension of cities and towns due to the increasing population is leading to further exploitation of the available land. <br />
