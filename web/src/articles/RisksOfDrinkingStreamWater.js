                    You're hiking and you see a clear stream with what seems to be drinkable water. The question is, do you drink it? Emergency room physician Dr. Troy Madsen tells you his views on drinking water directly from any babbling brook. He also tells you the one thing to bring in case you're that unlucky person who got poisoning from bad water. <br />
                    <br /> <br />
                    <b>Interviewer:</b> Is it okay to drink stream water if you're out camping or something like that? We're with Dr. Troy Madsen, Emergency Medicine at the University of Utah Hospital. We hear that it's bad. You should always take your own water. But is it? Do you see a lot of people visit in the ER for something like that? <br />
                    <br /> <br />
                    <b>Dr. Troy Madsen:</b>  I've rarely seen it. It's one of those things I've heard the same thing, and I certainly take the precaution where I don't stream water. Maybe that's why we don't see people because they're not drinking stream water. We don't see a lot of people. I've rarely seen anyone in the ER. I have heard of a few cases of people who drank some stream water or lake water and then came to the emergency department with profuse diarrhea, which is often what you get a week or two later. <br />
                    <br /> <br />
                    <b>Interviewer:</b> That's the big thing? <br />
                    <br /> <br />
                    <b>Dr. Troy Madsen:</b>  Yep. That's the big thing you get. But, again, I don't see it a lot, and it's probably because I think the risk is not really high, but the risk is there. It certainly is there, and the big thing we're worrying about is Giardia. <br />
                    <br /> <br />
                    <b>Interviewer:</b> okay. <br />
                    <br /> <br />
                    <b>Dr. Troy Madsen:</b>  That's something you can pick up from stream water or lake water. That's often the issue, and that's why we hear that, "Don't drink stream water or lake water." <br />
                    <br /> <br />
                    <b>Interviewer:</b> All right. So we're not encouraging that you do it, but at this point, in your opinion, if worse came to worse and you needed to have water, is it probably okay? <br />
                    <br /> <br />
                    <b>Dr. Troy Madsen:</b>  Yeah. If I were out somewhere and I needed water and I just felt like the thirst was going to affect my ability to get out of an area or hike out, I would drink the water. We're talking either about the immediate danger of severe dehydration versus the risk of an infection that's not going to hit you for one to two weeks, and that can typically be treated with antibiotics. So if I had to weigh the risks, I would err on the side of that infection. <br />
